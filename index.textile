h2. Introduction

Blue Collar is a system for performing backround work in .NET applications. It is essentially a job queue + job processor that relies on a database as its queue transport and storage medium. Some interesting things Blue Collar brings to the table include:

  * Single assembly with zero external dependencies.
  * Full-featured, web-based management dashboard is embedded into the assembly and is easy to configure.
  * Easy to distribute across machines.
  * Easy to share machines across applications, even using the same database.
  * Jobs require nothing more than inheriting from a base @Job@ class and implementing @Execute()@.

Although a polling, database-backed queue is not ideal for every situation, this system is flexible, easy to use, and can handle reasonably large throughput.
