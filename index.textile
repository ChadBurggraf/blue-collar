Blue Collar is a system for creating, managing, and executing background work in .NET applications. It is ideal for use in web applications, but can be set up for any environment where background work needs to be done.

Some cool features include:

* Embedded web-based management interface.
* Simple, single-assembly deployment, with no external dependencies.
* Easily perform work for multiple applications on one machine, or perform work for one application on multiple machines, or any combination in between.
* Jobs are simple .NET objects, implementing @string Name { get; }@ and @void Execute()@.
* Sensible defaults make getting up and running quickly a breeze.
